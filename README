NAME
    Attribute::Abstract - implementing abstract methods with attributes

SYNOPSIS
      package SomeObj;
      use Attribute::Abstract;

      sub new { ... }
      sub write : Abstract;

DESCRIPTION
    Declaring a subroutine to be abstract using this attribute causes a call
    to it to die with a suitable exception. Subclasses are expected to
    implement the abstract method.

    Using the attribute makes it visually distinctive that a method is
    abstract, as opposed to declaring it without any attribute or method
    body, or providing a method body that might make it look as though it
    was implemented after all.

BUGS
    None known so far. If you find any bugs or oddities, please do inform
    the author.
